# Road Accident Analysis & Parking Offences

* Implemented Descriptive data analysis on indian road accident dataset & NYC parking violations dataset.
* Used seaborn & matplotlib to analyse data with bar & scatter plots in jupyter notebook.
* Analyzed the cause of road accidents in different weather & road conditions. 
* Accelerated data processing and visualization using Apache Spark, Flask and Tableau.
* Used label encoding and onehot encoding.
* Model shows bar and pie charts on user selected state/UT and years using matplotlib and seaborn py libraries.
* Road Accident model predicts the total number of accidents which can be occured on selecting year and State/Ut.
* Parking Model Predicts the probability of causing parking violations which can be occurred in particular locations for particular months, days and timeslots.
